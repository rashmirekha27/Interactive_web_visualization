# Interactive_web_visualization: Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment i built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.Created a bubble chart that displays each sample. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information and deployed it in the github page.
